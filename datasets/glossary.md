# Glossary of Terms

*Grapheme* -- A grapheme is a small unit of language within a system of writing; this document is transcribed by means of the graphemes common to the English langauge. Typically a set of graphemes will be a standin or proxy for a spoken language, though many forms of graphic notation are prone to inconsistency and will not always correspond directly to the sounds they would represent. English is particularly prone to this issue; for more, see Phoneme.

*Phoneme* -- A phoneme is a small unit of a speech sound; in many languages, a single phoneme may be represented by a set of graphemes which may or may not have any corresponding sound individually. Several systems of phoneme notation for English exist, including CMUdict by Carnegie Mellon Universit, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, a language-agnostic system of notation by the International Phoneitc Association. TTS systems benefit from the use of phonetic notation when the language's graphic notation or graphemes are inconsistent.

*Phonics* -- Phonics is the system by which graphemes may be associated with phonemes for a given language. In the English language, phonics are notoriously inconsistent.

*Sibilance* -- In phonetics, a sibilant is a consonant sound of high amplitude and pitch; sibilance is the abrasive, high-frequency sound produced by these consonants. While they don't normally stand out to the average listener during the course of normal speech, when recorded sibilants often sound harsh and distracting. It is generally good practice to reduce sibilance during recording, either through microphone choice and placement, or after the fact using filter or de-esser. It is worth noting that the LJspeech dataset, a common benchmark for TTS applications, exhibits very harsh sibilance. The English words sip and ship are two examples of words exhibiting sibilance.

*Transliteration* -- The process by which one system of notation may be transformed into another system of notation. For example: Graphemes to Phonemes (G2P).
